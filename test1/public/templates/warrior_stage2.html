    <p>You have encountered the imperial army!</p><br />

    Emperor - A great victory was won today! That victory is not yours,but it can be.<br />

    Aeneas - Soldiers won the battle. Perhaps the Emperor was too far behind to see.<br />
    Emperor - History remembers emperors! Not soldiers!<br />
    Emperor - Tomorrow, we'll batter down the gates of Athens. This is your last chance to join me!<br />
    Aeneas - Never! I have witnessed your corrupted rule.<br />
    Emperor - Then you will face my most skilled warrior! If you win, i will let you go.<br />
    Otherwise... well it will be interesting to watch.
